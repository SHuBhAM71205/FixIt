i want to make a mini project in my college term projects
that should be simple and low level
with basic functionality covered and run effectively
can scale it on large scale later

using HTML , CSS , JAVVASCRIPT, PHP
user experience should be great ,great ui with responsive design
all color combination and theme should classic design
color tone should be addaptable
consistent design through  the web app

the app  maintenance request app
ooperate for smaller area

Admin Module
User Module
TaskMaster Module

key Functionality

User Can Sign Up / Sign In
Admin Can Sign In
TaskMaster Can SignUp and SignIn

TaskMaster SignUp request Should be Approved by admin
then only TaskMaster Can SignUp

User : a user that can make request for maintenance
Admin : who Review the Request add by user accordingly assign taksto the taks master
TaskMastr : A technician or a worker who is certified and can solve the maintence issue

repost also

Admin can view overall report
individual TaskMaster's statistics

TaskMaster Can Set Status OnWorking / OffWorking

Requsting for Mainteance there are some predefined Work Area
like
Water Requading Work
Electicity Requatdig work
Electric equipment repainring work

these kind of 5-10 fields

and taskmaster have area of field in which he can work accordingly that task assign to him by admin

admin can reject the maintanence request with Feedback Message

similarly if admin assign task to the TaskMaster He/she can also reject it with message

This is a fantastic project idea! Hereâ€™s a structured plan to develop your **Maintenance Request App** with the required features and technologies. The project will be simple to start and scalable for future expansion.

## **2. Detailed Functionality**

### **A. User Module**
- **Sign Up / Sign In:**  
  - Users register with basic details (name, email, contact info, and password).  
  - Login using email and password.  

- **Request Maintenance:**  
  - Select a predefined work area (e.g., Water, Electricity, etc.).  
  - Add a description of the issue (optional).  
  - View request status (Pending, In Progress, Completed).  

- **View History & Feedback:**  
  - View previously requested tasks.  
  - Repost an issue for unresolved or repeated problems.  
  - Provide feedback and rate TaskMaster after task completion.

  - Admins log in with unique credentials.  

- **Manage TaskMaster Approvals:**  
  - Review TaskMaster signup requests.  
  - Approve or reject requests with feedback messages.  

- **Manage Maintenance Requests:**  
  - View maintenance requests from users.  
  - Assign tasks to TaskMasters based on their expertise.  
  - Reject user requests with feedback.  

- **Task Management:**  
  - Monitor assigned tasks and their progress.  
  - View and manage TaskMaster availability (OnWorking/OffWorking).  

- **Generate Reports:**  
  - View overall reports of maintenance requests, task statuses, and feedback.  
  - View individual TaskMaster performance statistics.  

---

### **C. TaskMaster Module**
- **Sign Up / Sign In:**  
  - Register with qualifications and areas of expertise.
